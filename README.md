Hey Guys,

I'll continuously update this Readme file with up to date stuff.

So far I have an app that completes an Android Beam activity and that writes to NFC tags. 

Very basic graphics. 

Main Activity->(click "Go TO Scan Screen") -> NFC Beam
  This will initialize the android beaming. To make it work both devices have to be running the same program
Main Activity->(click "Go TO Scan Screen") -> NFC Write
  This will write whatever text you fill in into the tag of your choice.
